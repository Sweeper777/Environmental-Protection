    <h1>DESERTIFICATION</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Desertification is a phenomenon that ranks among the greatest environmental challenges 
            of our time. Yet most people haven't heard of it or don’t understand it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although desertification can include the encroachment of sand dunes on land, it doesn’t
             refer to the advance of deserts. Rather, it is the persistent degradation 
            of dryland ecosystems by human activities — including unsustainable 
            farming, mining, overgrazing and clear-cutting of land — and by climate 
            change.
        </p>

        <h3>What Causes Desertification?</h3>
        Desertification occurs when:
            <ul>
                <li>the tree and plant cover that binds the soil is removed. It occurs when trees and 
            bushes are stripped away for fuelwood and timber, or to clear land for 
            cultivation. </li>
                <li>animals eat away grasses and erode topsoil with their hooves. </li>
                <li>intensive farming depletes the nutrients in the soil. </li>
                <li>Wind and water erosion aggravate the damage, carrying away topsoil and leaving behind 
                a highly infertile mix of dust and sand. It is the combination of 
                these factors that transforms degraded land into desert.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Impact of Desertification</h3>
        <p>
            Desertification is a global issue, with serious implications worldwide for 
            biodiversity, eco-safety, poverty eradication, socio-economic stability 
            and sustainable development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Drylands are already fragile. As they become degraded, the impact on people, livestock 
            and environment can be devastating. Some 50 million people may be 
            displaced within the next 10 years as a result of desertification.
        </p>
        <p>
            The issue of desertification is not new though — it played a significant role in human 
            history, contributing to the collapse of several large empires, and the 
            displacement of local populations. But today, the pace of arable land 
            degradation is estimated at 30 to 35 times the historical rate.
        </p>

        <h3>Desertification and Poverty</h3>
        <p>
            Two billion people depend on ecosystems in dry land areas, 90% of whom live in 
            developing countries.
        </p>
        <p>
            A downward spiral is created in many underdeveloped countries where overpopulation 
            causes pressure to exploit drylands for farming. These marginally 
            productive regions are overgrazed, the land is exhausted and groundwater 
            is overdrafted.
        </p>
        <p>
            When rural land becomes unable to support the local population the result is mass 
    migrations to urban areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            The increased frequency and severity of droughts resulting from projected climate 
            change is likely to further exacerbate desertification.
        </p>

        <h3>Sad but true! Facts and figures on desertification</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Drylands cover nearly 41% of the Earth and are home to nearly 2 billion people 
    (one-third of the world's population);</li>
            <li>It is estimated that between 10 and 20 percent of drylands are already degraded.</li>
            <li>The problem is most acute in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.</li>
            <li>The total land area affected by desertification is estimated as between 6-12 
    million sq.kms (for comparison, the countries of Brazil, Canada and China are all 
    between 8-10 million sq.kms).</li>
            <li>Drylands support a huge diversity of life, including some of humankind's most 
    ancient cultures.</li>
            <li>More than 60% of the world's ecosystems are in decline, or even degraded to an 
    extent that we can no longer rely on their services. These include drylands, as 
    well as forests, fisheries and even the air we breath.</li>
            <li>It is estimated that desertification and drought account for a $ 42 billion yearly 
    loss in food productivity worldwide.</li>
            <li>Nearly one-third of the world's cropland has been abandoned in the past 40 years 
    because of erosion. Each year an additional 20 million hectares of agricultural 
    land either becomes too degraded for crop production, or become lost to urban 
    sprawl.</li>
            <li>Dust eminating from the Saharan Desert has been implicated in respiratory problems 
    as far away as North America, and has affected coral reefs in the Caribbean.</li>
            <li>Restoring soil lost by erosion is a very slow process. It can take 500 years for 
    2.5 cm of soil to form.</li>
