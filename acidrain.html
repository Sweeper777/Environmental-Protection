    <h1>ACID RAIN</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <h3>What is Acid Rain</h3>
        <p>
            Acid rain is rain consisting of water droplets that are unusually acidic because of 
            atmospheric pollution - most notably the excessive amounts of sulfur and 
            nitrogen released by cars and industrial processes. Acid rain is also 
            called acid deposition because this term includes other forms of acidic 
            precipitation such as snow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Acidic deposition occurs in two ways: wet and dry. Wet deposition is any form of 
            precipitation that removes acids from the atmosphere and deposits them on 
            the Earth’s surface.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dry deposition polluting particles and gases stick to the ground via dust and smoke in 
            the absence of precipitation. This form of deposition is dangerous however 
            because precipitation can eventually wash pollutants into streams, lakes, 
            and rivers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Acidity itself is determined based on the pH level of the water droplets. PH is the 
            scale measuring the amount of acid in the water and liquid. The pH scale 
            ranges from 0 to 14 with lower pH being more acidic while a high pH is 
            alkaline; seven is neutral. Normal rain water is slightly acidic and has a 
            pH range of 5.3-6.0. Acid deposition is anything below that scale. It is 
            also important to note that the pH scale is logarithmic and each whole 
            number on the scale represents a 10-fold change.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, acid deposition is present in the north-eastern United States, south-eastern 
            Canada, and much of Europe including portions of Sweden, Norway, and 
            Germany. In addition, parts of South Asia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, 
            and Southern India are all in danger of being impacted by acid deposition 
            in the future.
        </p>

        <h3>Causes and History of Acid Rain</h3>
        <p>
            <img alt="An image showing how acid rain is formed" src="images/acidrain1.jpg"  height="320" width="550"/>
            Acid deposition can occur via natural sources like volcanoes but it is mainly caused 
            by the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide during fossil fuel 
            combustion. When these gases are discharged into the atmosphere they react 
            with the water, oxygen, and other gases already present there to form 
            sulfuric acid, ammonium nitrate, and nitric acid. These acids then 
            disperse over large areas because of wind patterns and fall back to the 
            ground as acid rain or other forms of precipitation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The gases responsible for acid deposition are normally a byproduct of electric power 
            generation and the burning of coal. As such, it began entering the 
            atmosphere in large amounts during the Industrial Revolution and was first 
            discovered by a Scottish chemist, Robert Angus Smith, in 1852. In that 
            year, he discovered the relationship between acid rain and atmospheric 
            pollution in Manchester, England.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although it was discovered in the 1800s, acid deposition did not gain significant 
            public attention until the 1960s and the term acid rain was coined in 1972.
             Public attention further increased in the 1970s when the New York Times 
            published reports about problems occurring in the Hubbard Brook 
            Experimental Forest in New Hampshire.

        <h3>Effects of Acid Rain</h3>
        <p>
            <img alt="An image showing a corroded sculpture" src="images/acidrain2.jpg"/>
            After studying the Hubbard Brook Forest and other areas today, there are several 
            important impacts of acid deposition on both natural and man-made 
            environments. Aquatic settings are the most clearly impacted by acid 
            deposition though because acidic precipitation falls directly into them. 
            Both dry and wet deposition also runs off of forests, fields, and roads 
            and flows into lakes, rivers, and streams.
        </p>
        <p>
            As this acidic liquid flows into larger bodies of water, it is diluted but over time,
             acids can accrue and lower the overall pH of the body. Acid deposition 
            also causes clay soils to release aluminum and magnesium further lowering 
            the pH in some areas. If the pH of a lake drops below 4.8, its plants and 
            animals risk death and it is estimated that around 50,000 lakes in the 
            United States and Canada have a pH below normal (about 5.3 for water). 
            Several hundred of these have a pH too low to support any aquatic life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from aquatic bodies, acid deposition can significantly impact forests. As acid 
            rain falls on trees, it can make them lose their leaves, damage their 
            bark, and stunt their growth. By damaging these parts of the tree, it 
            makes them vulnerable to disease, extreme weather, and insects. Acid 
            falling on a forest’s soil is also harmful because it disrupts soil 
            nutrients, kills microorganisms in the soil, and can sometimes cause a 
            calcium deficiency. Trees at high altitudes are also susceptible to 
            problems induced by acidic cloud cover as the moisture in the clouds 
            blankets them.
            <p>
                Damage to forests by acid rain is seen all over the world, but the most advanced cases 
                are in Eastern Europe. It’s estimated that in Germany and Poland, half 
                of the forests are damaged, while 30% in Switzerland have been 
                affected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, acid deposition also has an impact on architecture and art because of its 
            ability to corrode certain materials. As acid lands on buildings 
            (especially those constructed with limestone) it reacts with minerals in 
            the stones sometimes causing it to disintegrate and wash away. Acid 
            deposition can also corrode modern buildings, cars, railroad tracks, 
            airplanes, steel bridges, and pipes above and below ground.
