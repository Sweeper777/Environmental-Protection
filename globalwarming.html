    <h1>GLOBAL WARMING</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Throughout its long history, Earth has warmed and cooled time and again. 
            Climate has changed when the planet received more or less sunlight due to 
            subtle shifts in its orbit, as the atmosphere or surface changed, or when 
            the Sun’s energy varied. But in the past century, another force has 
            started to influence Earth’s climate: humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
            How does this warming compare to previous changes in Earth’s climate? How can we be 
    certain that human-released greenhouse gases are causing the warming? How much 
    more will the Earth warm? How will Earth respond? Answering these questions is 
    perhaps the most significant scientific challenge of our time.
        </p>

        <h3>What is Global Warming?</h3>
        <p>
            Global warming is the unusually rapid increase in Earth’s average surface temperature 
            over the past century primarily due to the greenhouse gases released as 
            people burn fossil fuels. The global average surface temperature rose 0.6 
            to 0.9 degrees Celsius (1.1 to 1.6° F) between 1906 and 2005, and the rate 
            of temperature increase has nearly doubled in the last 50 years. 
            Temperatures are certain to go up further.
        </p>

        <h3>The enhanced greenhouse effect</h3>
        <p>
            What has scientists concerned now is that over the past 250 years, humans have been 
            artificially raising the concentration of greenhouse gases in the 
            atmosphere at an ever-increasing rate, mostly by burning fossil fuels, 
            but also from cutting down carbon-absorbing forests. Since the Industrial 
            Revolution began in about 1750, carbon dioxide levels have increased 
            nearly 38 percent as of 2009 and methane levels have increased 148 percent.
            <p>
                The atmosphere today contains more greenhouse gas molecules, so more of the infrared 
                energy emitted by the surface ends up being absorbed by the atmosphere.
                 Since some of the extra energy from a warmer atmosphere radiates back 
                down to the surface, Earth’s surface temperature rises. By increasing 
                the concentration of greenhouse gases, we are making Earth’s 
                atmosphere a more efficient greenhouse.

            Increases in concentrations of carbon dioxide (top) and methane (bottom) coincided 
            with the start of the Industrial Revolution in about 1750. Measurements 
            from Antarctic ice cores (green lines) combined with direct atmospheric 
            measurements (blue lines) show the increase of both gases over time.

        <h3>Global Warming Impacts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rising Seas --- inundation of fresh water marshlands (the everglades), low-lying 
    cities, and islands with seawater. </li>
            <li>Changes in rainfall patterns --- droughts and fires in some areas, flooding in 
    other areas. See the section above on the recent droughts, for example! </li>
            <li>Increased likelihood of extreme events --- such as flooding, hurricanes, etc. </li>
            <li>Melting of the ice caps --- loss of habitat near the poles. Polar bears are now 
    thought to be greatly endangered by the shortening of their feeding season due to 
    dwindling ice packs.  </li>
            <li>Melting glaciers --- significant melting of old glaciers is already observed. </li>
            <li>Widespread vanishing of animal populations --- following widespread habitat loss. </li>
            <li>Spread of disease --- migration of diseases such as malaria to new, now warmer, 
    regions. </li>
            <li>Bleaching of Coral Reefs due to warming seas and acidification due to carbonic 
    acid formation --- One third of coral reefs now appear to have been severely 
    damaged by warming seas.</li>
            <li>Loss of Plankton due to warming seas --- The enormous (900 mile long) Aleution island 
                ecosystems of orcas (killer whales), sea lions, sea otters, sea 
                urchins, kelp beds, and fish populations, appears to have collapsed 
                due to loss of plankton, leading to loss of sea lions, leading orcas 
                to eat too many sea otters, leading to urchin explosions, leading to 
                loss of kelp beds and their associated fish populations.  </li>
        </ul>

            <h1>Melting Icebergs</h1> <i>By Sweeper</i>
            <p>
                Can you hear the ice is cracking?<br />
                Can you see the icebergs are melting?<br />
                Do you know polar bears are dying?<br />
                Do you know what is happening?
            </p>
            <p>
                Slowly, slowly, icebergs melt<br />
                The polar bears cry for help.<br />
                Gradually, gradually, sea level rise<br />
                Terrible floods arrive! 
            </p>
            <p>
                We can stop it!<br />
                If everyone tries a little bit <br />
                So that icebergs dry their tears<br />
                And polar bears have no more fears!
