    <h1>POLLUTION</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <h3>Air Pollution</h3>
        <p>
            According to the dictionary, air pollution is the contamination of air by smoke and 
            harmful gases, mainly oxides of carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen. (And maybe 
            by that smelly uncle.) Some examples of air pollution include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Exhuast fumes from vehicles</li>
            <li>The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, or gas</li>
            <li>Harmful off-gasing from things such as paint, plastic production, and so on</li>
            <li>Radiation spills or nuclear accidents</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Air pollution is linked to asthma, allergies and other respiratory illnesses.
        </p>
        <h3>Land Pollution</h3>
        <p>
            Land pollution is the degradation of the Earth's surface caused by a misuse of 
            resources and improper disposal of waste. Some examples of land pollution 
            include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Litter found on the side of the road</li>
            <li>Illegal dumping in natural habitats</li>
            <li>Oil spills that happen inland</li>
            <li>The use of pesticides and other farming chemicals</li>
            <li>Damage and debris caused from unsustainable mining and logging practices</li>
            <li>Radiation spills or nuclear accidents</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Land pollution is responsible for damage done to natural habitat of animals, 
            deforestation and damage done to natural resources, and the general 
            ugly-ing up of our communities. (So stop being a litterbug, eh?)
        </p>

        <h3>Light Pollution</h3>
        <p>
            Light pollution is the brightening of the night sky inhibiting the visibility of stars 
            and planets by the use of improper lighting of communities. Some examples 
            of what causes light pollution:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Street lamps that shine light in all directions, instead of with a hood to 
         point light downward toward the street.</li>
            <li>Extra, unnecessary lights around the home</li>
            <li>Cities that run lights all night long</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Light pollution uses more energy (by shining more light up instead of down, meaning 
            you need brighter bulbs for the same amount of light), may affect human 
            health and our sleep cycles, and most importantly, corrupts our kids 
            telescopes and their curiosity. (I grew up in a city. My first no-light 
            night in the country blew my mind. Let's not make that such a rare 
            occasion!)
        </p>

        <h3>Noise Pollution</h3>
        <p>
            Noise pollution is any loud sounds that are either harmful or annoying to humans and 
            animals. Some exmaples of noise pollution:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Airplanes, helicopters, and motor vehicles</li>
            <li>Construction or demolition noise</li>
            <li>Human activities such as sporting events or concerts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Noise pollution can be disruptive to humans' stress levels, may be harmful to unborn 
            babies, and drives animals away by causing nervousness and decreasing 
            their ability to hear prey or predators.
        </p>
        <h3>Water Pollution</h3>
        <p>
            Water pollution is the contamination of any body of water (lakes, groundwater, oceans, 
            etc). Some examples of water pollution:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Raw sewage running into lake or streams</li>
            <li>Industrial waste spills contaminating groundwater</li>
            <li>Radiation spills or nuclear accidents</li>
            <li>Illegal dumping of substances or items within bodies of water</li>
            <li>Biological contamination, such as bacteria growth</li>
            <li>Farm runoff into nearby bodies of water</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These kinds of environmental pollution are linked to health issues in humans, animals 
    and plant-life.
