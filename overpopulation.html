    <h1>OVERPOPULATION</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>

            As of August 6, 2015 the world's human population is estimated to be 7.262 billion.
        The population is expected to reach between 8 and 10.5 billion between the 
        year 2040.

        <p>
            Overpopulation isn't just population density (amount of people per landmass). 
        Overpopulation applies much more so to the number of people in an area 
        exceeding the resources and the carrying capacity of the environment necessary 
        to sustain human activities. So much focus is placed on the rapid population 
        growth in third world countries. However, when we compare lifestyles of the 
        rich countries vs. the poor countries, the rich countries are a much greater 
        problem. For example, Americans constitute less than five percent of the 
        world's total population, but consume 26% of the world's energy. Just as much 
        as the population size, we need to consider the resources consumed by each 
        person, and the damage done by technologies used to supply them. Overpopulation
         is when the number of people can not be permanently maintained without 
        depleting resources and without degrading the environment and the people's 
        standard of living. Because we are rapidly using up resources around the 
        world, virtually all nations are overpopulated. This applies even more so to 
        the rich nations. As we use up the resources, the earth's carrying capacity 
        continues to decrease.
        </p>

            Just like with people, an overpopulation of animals is not defined by the number of 
        animals that could hypothetically fit within a specific area, but rather when 
        the number of animals that occupy their habitat are not capable of behaving as 
        they naturally would. Unfortunately, the animals' behavior is often altered 
        not so much by their number, but by humans encroaching upon their habitat and 
        then claiming the animal to be a nuisance to man. We should practice the 
        saying "live and let live", but we do not have the resources to do this while 
        our number continues to increase.
