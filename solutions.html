    <h1>SOLUTIONS</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <h3>Alternative sources of energy </h3>
        <img alt="Solar Panels" src="images/solutions1.jpg" height="262" width="438" />
        <p>
            Burning fossil fuels to produce energy causes a lot of pollution. Renewable sources of 
        energy such as wind power, wave power and solar power are much cleaner. 
        People can also easily reduce the amount of energy they use. A lot of 
        electricity is wasted by leaving on lights, televisions, and other electrical 
        equipment when they are not being used.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of solar power in the home is becoming an attractive proposition for a 
            growing number of people. In fact, many people use solar power by 
            harnessing the sun's energy to heat their homes and to run different 
            appliances. It is an economical and earth-friendly way to bring power into 
            the home. In addition, solar power is also used to generate hot water. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The most basic technology used in solar power is the solar electric panel. 
            These panels use photons in order to generate electricity. These 
            photovoltaic (PV) panels can be free standing rigid sheets used to harness 
            the sun's energy. They can also be set into the roof, or you can get peel 
            and stick laminates, depending on your roof type. Obviously, such solution 
            is far from expensive and easy to do but its advantages are undeniable. 
        </p>

        <h3>Environmentally-friendly forms of transport </h3>
        <p>
            <img alt="Cycling" src="images/solutions2.jpg" width="219" height="153" />
            If more people used public transport, this would reduce the amount of pollution. 
            Public transport is much more environmentally-friendly, because buses 
            and trains can carry large numbers of people at same time, whereas cars 
            often carry only one person. Car pools are another way of reducing the 
            number of cars on our roads. The big car companies are also working on 
            developing new engine technology, so that cars can run on cleaner fuels 
            such as hydrogen instead of petrol. For shorter journeys cycling is a much 
            healthier alternative to driving a car, and many towns have introduce 
            special cycle lanes.
        </p>

        <h3>Green products </h3>
        <p>
            <img alt="Green Products with Green Technology" src="images/solutions3.jpg" height="225" width="480" />
            Choosing to buy green products also help the environment, for example organic foods 
    that are produced without using pesticides. Not only are pesticides detrimental 
    for the environment, the chemicals in them can also be harmful to humans. 
    Practically, each household can make their own small garden for growing organic 
    vegetables. There are numerous kinds of vegetable which are easy to grow for 
    short-term, especially good for people’s health and environment. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If we buy wood from sustainable sources, this will mean that our forests can be 
    maintained for future generations. We can also use other materials such as bamboo 
            instead of wood to make stuff. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Say no with plastic bag! We can use green bags such as paper bag to put things in. 
            Clearly, when people go to the market to buy things, they always take one
             plastic bag for one thing. It’s unnecessary and very damaging to 
            environment. Thus, using reuseable shopping bags such as canvas fabric 
            bag would reduce the number of plastic bags dumped into environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            So much of modern life is based around shopping and buying new things. Everything is 
            out-of-date in only a few years or even months. If we stopped buying and 
            throwing away so many things, this would help ease the pressure on the 
            environment.
        </p>

        <h3>Recycling waste </h3>
        <p>
            <img alt="Reuse Reduce Recycle" src="images/solutions4.jpg" height="177" width="250" />
            Although we try to reduce the amount of wastes, it’s undeniable that there are still a 
            large number of wastes dumped into environment everyday. Hence, recycling 
            waste appears to be the best solution for remained wastes. There are some 
            actions that each household can do to protect and save environment. They 
            are 3R: reduce-reuse-recycle. While we collect our wastes, we should 
            separate them into different boxes for plastic, metal, glass, organic 
            waste, ect…Nowadays, most kind of wastes can recycle to make new things. 
            Each kind of waste has its own recycling process. If all wastes are 
            recycled, there will be a significant decrease in the number of wastes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, the fact in some developing and poor countries is that the regular 
            collection service and the consciousness of community are very poor. 
            Moreover, the number of the unemployed is getting higher and higher. 
            Why don’t they create their own job from waste? They can collect household 
            wastes from their house and other houses and then separate. They can sell 
            separated wastes for recycling factories. The salary depends on the amount 
            of wastes they have. The more money they want to earn, the more wastes 
            they have to collect and separate.
        </p>
        <h3>Eco-tourism </h3>
        <p>
            <img alt="Eco-tourism" src="images/solutions5.jpg" />
            According to the development of economy, people today tend to take vacation to hot spot
             in the world for traveling and relaxing. However, most of them choose 
            favorite places with resorts, spas and other modern entertainment. 
            Obviously, the environment of such places will get worse as the great 
            pressure of the large number of travelers. Thus, eco-tourism seems to be 
            the effective way to protect environment but interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ecotourism is travel to fragile, pristine, and usually protected areas that strives to 
            be lowimpact and often small scale. It helps educate the traveler; 
            provides funds for conservation; directly benefits the economic 
            development and political empowerment of local communities; and fosters 
            respect for different cultures and for human rights. Responsible 
            ecotourism includes programs that minimize the negative aspects of 
            conventional tourism on the environment and enhance the cultural integrity 
            of localpeople. Therefore, in addition to evaluating environmental and 
            cultural factors, an integral part of ecotourism is the promotion of 
            recycling, energy efficiency, water conservation and creation of economic 
            opportunities for the local communities. Another interesting idea is that 
            tourists can home stay with local people instead of booking five stars 
            hotel with modern conditions. They also can study how local people work 
            such as planting rice, catch-fishing, etc
        </p>

        <h3>Green Education </h3>
        <p>
            <img alt="Environmental Education" src="images/solutions6.jpg" />
            No matter how many solutions we have, it would be nothing if people can’t recognize 
            the vital role of environment. People should be aware of environmental 
            alarm and take more responsibilities for environment crisis. Accordingly, 
            education is the best solution. Green education is to assist individuals 
            or social groups to become aware, and sensible, to the environment and its 
            problems as a whole, to increase a diversity of experiences, and to obtain
             a basic comprehension of the environment and its related problems.
